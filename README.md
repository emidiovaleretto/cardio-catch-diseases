<h3> Small causes with great effects </h3>

Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is a generic term for all pathological changes that affect the heart and/or blood vessels. The term includes coronary heart disease (a disease that affects the blood vessels that supply the heart), hypertension and atherosclerosis. One of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease is hypertension (high blood pressure).

Prolonged high blood pressure leads to changes in blood vessel walls that interfere with blood flow and result in the heart not receiving enough oxygen. The heart reacts with pain, which is called angina pectoris (which literally means "tightness in the chest").

The complete blockage of blood flow results in a myocardial infarction (a heart attack). This is, in general, a consequence of advanced coronary arteriosclerosis.

<h3> Important factors </h3>

In the year 2000, cardiovascular diseases were the cause of about one-third of all deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the main causes of death in industrialized countries. That is 2010 cardiovascular diseases will also have become the main cause of death in developing countries.

Cardiovascular diseases are a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels and include:

  - **Coronary heart disease** - disease of the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle;
  - **Cerebrovascular disease** - disease of the blood vessels that supply the brain;
  - **Peripheral arterial disease** - disease of the blood vessels that supply the upper and lower limbs;
  - **Rheumatic heart disease** - damage to the heart muscle and heart valves due to rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria;
  - **Congenital heart disease** - malformations in the structure of the heart that has existed since birth;
  - **Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism** - blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.

<h1> | Global Statistics </h1>
<br>
Cardiovascular diseases are the **leading cause of death in the world**: more people die annually from these diseases than from any other cause.

It is estimated that **17.9 million people** died from cardiovascular disease in 2016, representing **31% of all deaths globally**. Of these deaths, it is estimated that 85% occur due to heart attacks and strokes (strokes).

**More than three quarters of deaths** from cardiovascular disease occur in low- and middle-income countries.

Of the **17 million premature deaths** (people under the age of 70) from chronic non-communicable diseases, **82%** occur in low and middle income countries and **37%** are caused by cardiovascular diseases.
